# How to Build

## Prepare dependencies

* JDK 1.8 (JDK 1.9+ are not supported yet)
* On Linux Ubuntu system (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS), ensure that the machine has [__Oracle JDK 8__]
* Open **UDP** ports for connection to the network
* **MINIMUM** 2 CPU Cores

## Getting the code with git

* Use Git from the console, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles.
* `develop` branch: the newest code 
* `master` branch: more stable than develop.
In the shell command, type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-cypher.git
git checkout -t origin/master
```

## Building from source code

**Building using the console:**

```bash
cd java-cypher
./gradlew build -x test
```
